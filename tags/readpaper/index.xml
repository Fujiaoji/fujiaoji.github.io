    <description><![CDATA[I. Introduction 1. Situation of anti-phishing method Phishing webpages try to deceive paper by high visual similarity between phishing webpage and legistimate ones. Some methods maintain a list of commonly attack pages (domain name and their screenshots). However, these methods have limitations: 1) list is small; 2) attackers can bypass detection by crafting partially similar pshihing pages with different background pictures.
2. Contributions of this paper Present dataset of VisualPhish, 155 trust websites with 9363 pages.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I. Introduction 1. Situation of anti-phishing method Manually verified anti-phishing blacklist: use dynamic blacklists to track reported phishing URLs. eg. Google Classification-based methods: trained from collecting phishing dataset, perform binary classification Reference-based methods: detecting phishing attacks by referencing a set of representations of well-known brands. 2. Challenges The blacklists and collected phishing webpages used for training become obsolete very quickly, resulting in a never-ending cat-and-mouse game between phishing attacks and defenses that are based on blacklists/classification.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Cannot used&hellip; I. Main Contributions Multi-scale CNN used in a Siamese network. This CNN learns a joint image embedding of top as well as lower layers. Employed a novel online pair mining strategy inspired from Curriculum learning which ensures the model finds better local minima. II. Data Used Supervised ML model, need positive and negative pairs CIFAR10, 32*32 III. SIAMESE NETWORK Share parameters ]]></description>
